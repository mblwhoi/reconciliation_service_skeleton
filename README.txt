A skeleton for creating a Google Refine 2.0 reconciliation service.

This repository is intended to be a basic template for a Google Refine reconciliation service.  It is expected that you would modify the included code for your own purposes.

Requirements:
1. Python

Instructions:

1. Download the files in this repository to a directory on your computer. e.g. 'git clone git://github.com/mblwhoi/reconciliation_service_skeleton.git recon_skeleton'

2. Run 'example_composers_reconciliation_service.py' e.g. 'cd recon_skelton; python example_composers_reconciliation_service.py'.  This will start a reconciliation service on port 5000 which you can use with Google Refine.
